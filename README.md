## Credits
This plugin started as a wish to extract the CargoNetwork that is part of the Slimefun4 plugin.
Unfortunately, it turned out to be way too intermingled and intertwined with the rest of Slimefun - so the only part of that solution that ended up in this plugin, is partly the name and partly the idea of having 3 types of cargo-nodes.
